# Project Title

## Overview

What is your app? Brief description in a couple of sentences.

The is MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) Application that facilitate the scheduling and management of doctor appointments. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern, with Node.js handling the server-side logic, Express.js managing routes and middleware, React.js handling the client-side interface, and MongoDB serving as the database.

### Problem

Why is your app needed? Background information around any pain points or other reasons.

The doctor appointment system offers a solution to the inefficiencies and frustrations commonly experienced in traditional appointment scheduling. By leveraging modern technology, it simplifies the process for both patients and medical staff. Patients can easily book appointments online, reducing the need for time-consuming phone calls and enabling them to choose convenient time slots. For healthcare providers, the system optimizes resource allocation, minimizes wait times, and enhances data management through centralized record-keeping. Ultimately, the system improves overall efficiency, patient satisfaction, and the quality of care provided by medical facilities.

### User Profile

Who will use your app? How will they use it? Any special considerations that your app must take into account.

The doctor appointment system will be utilized by both patients and healthcare providers. Patients will access the app to schedule appointments, view available time slots, receive reminders, and access medical information. Healthcare providers, including doctors and administrative staff, will use the platform to manage appointments, access patient records, and optimize scheduling

### Features

List the functionality that your app will include. These can be written as user stories or descriptions with related details. Do not describe _how_ these features are implemented, only _what_ needs to be implemented.

User Registration and Authentication
Appointment Scheduling
Appointment Management
Patient Profile Management
Admin Dashboard
Integration with Calendar Systems
Notification Management
User Doctor List
Booking Page

## Implementation

### Tech Stack

List technologies that will be used in your app, including any libraries to save time or provide more functionality. Be sure to research any potential limitations.

The doctor appointment system will utilize MongoDB for database management, Express.js for API development, and React.js for frontend interface creation. Mongoose will simplify MongoDB interactions, JWT will ensure secure authentication, and Redux will manage application state. Axios will handle HTTP requests.

### APIs

List any external sources of data that will be used in your app.
I will work to search for and integrate external data sources that enhance the functionality and utility of our doctor appointment system.

### Sitemap

List the pages of your app with brief descriptions. You can show this visually, or write it out.
User Side:Home Page || Appointments || Profile Page || Login/Logout
Doctors's side: Home || Appointments || Apply Doctor || Login/Logout

### Mockups

### Data

Describe your data and the relationships between them. You can show this visually using diagrams, or write it out.

Provide visuals of your app's screens. You can use tools like Figma or pictures of hand-drawn sketches.
User: Represents both patients and doctors who interact with the system.Both doctor and patient can login by Username, email.
Doctor: Specialties, office hours, contact information will be shown.
Appointment: Date, time, status (pending/rejected/approved), doctor ID, patient ID will be reflected.

### Endpoints

List endpoints that your server will implement, including HTTP methods, parameters, and example responses.
http://localhost:3000/login
http://localhost:3000/register
http://localhost:3000/apply-doctor
http://localhost:3000/notification
http://localhost:3000/admin/users
http://localhost:3000/admin/doctors
http://localhost:3000/doctor/id
http://localhost:3000/doctor/profile/id
http://localhost:3000/doctor/book-appointment/id
http://localhost:3000/appointments

### Auth

Does your project include any login or user profile functionality? If so, describe how authentication/authorization will be implemented.

Yes, the project includes login and user profile functionality. Authentication and authorization will be implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure access to the system's resources.

## Roadmap

Scope your project as a sprint. Break down the tasks that will need to be completed and map out timeframes for implementation. Think about what you can reasonably complete before the due date. The more detail you provide, the easier it will be to build.
Day 1-2 : EnvironmentSetup,Node MVC Server,Create ReactApp ,Routing || login and register form,
Day3-4: Database Connection and user model routes controller setup,UserRegisteration
Dat 4-5: Login user with JWT Token ,Authorization with JWT,users and doctors list
Day 5-6: Redux Tooolkit setup,Private public Routes,Admin Control pages
Day 6-7: Layout setup,getting user details,doctor Model form,Book Appointments,check availabiltiy
Day 7-8 :Api and Testing with form,Admin notifications,delete notifications
Day 9-10: Get and update doctor pofile,get doctors list,booking page

## Nice-to-haves

Your project will be marked based on what you committed to in the above document. Under nice-to-haves, you can list any additional features you may complete if you have extra time, or after finishing.
Integrating google calanders that Allow users to sync their appointments with their Google Calendar or other calendar services for better schedule management.
Create a feedback and review system where patients can provide ratings and reviews for doctors, helping other users make informed decisions.
